# Social Network API: with NoSQL 
An API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list.

>*Important*: Using  Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript `Date` object to format timestamps.

## Why
MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data; in combination with several of other technologies that social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications. Because the foundation of these applications is data, it’s important to understand how to build and structure the API first.

>*Important*: Because this application won’t be deployed, a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality is provide below in link.

## User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Preview

>*Important*: The following animations show examples of the application's API routes being tested in Insomnia.

The following animation shows GET routes to return a single user and a single thought being tested in Insomnia:

The following animation shows the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for users being tested in Insomnia:

In addition to this, your walkthrough video should show the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for thoughts being tested in Insomnia.

The following animation shows the POST and DELETE routes for a user’s friend list being tested in Insomnia:

In addition to this, your walkthrough video should show the POST and DELETE routes for reactions to thoughts being tested in Insomnia.

## Getting Started

Use the following guidelines to set up your models and API routes:

### Models

**User**:

* `username`
  * String
  * Unique
  * Required
  * Trimmed

* `email`
  * String
  * Required
  * Unique
  * Must match a valid email address (look into Mongoose's matching validation)

* `thoughts`
  * Array of `_id` values referencing the `Thought` model

* `friends`
  * Array of `_id` values referencing the `User` model (self-reference)

**Schema Settings**:

Create a virtual called `friendCount` that retrieves the length of the user's `friends` array field on query.

---

**Thought**:

* `thoughtText`
  * String
  * Required
  * Must be between 1 and 280 characters

* `createdAt`
  * Date
  * Set default value to the current timestamp
  * Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query

* `username` (The user that created this thought)
  * String
  * Required

* `reactions` (These are like replies)
  * Array of nested documents created with the `reactionSchema`

**Schema Settings**:

Create a virtual called `reactionCount` that retrieves the length of the thought's `reactions` array field on query.

---

**Reaction** (SCHEMA ONLY)

* `reactionId`
  * Use Mongoose's ObjectId data type
  * Default value is set to a new ObjectId

* `reactionBody`
  * String
  * Required
  * 280 character maximum

* `username`
  * String
  * Required

* `createdAt`
  * Date
  * Set default value to the current timestamp
  * Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query

**Schema Settings**:

This will not be a model, but rather will be used as the `reaction` field's subdocument schema in the `Thought` model.

### API Routes

**`/api/users`**

* `GET` all users

* `GET` a single user by its `_id` and populated thought and friend data

* `POST` a new user:

```json
// example data
{
  "username": "james",
  "email": "james@gmail.com"
}
```

* `PUT` to update a user by its `_id`

* `DELETE` to remove user by its `_id`

---

**`/api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId`**

* `POST` to add a new friend to a user's friend list

* `DELETE` to remove a friend from a user's friend list

---

**`/api/thoughts`**

* `GET` to get all thoughts

* `GET` to get a single thought by its `_id`

* `POST` to create a new thought (don't forget to push the created thought's `_id` to the associated user's `thoughts` array field)

```json
// example data
{
  "thoughtText": "Here's a cool thought...",
  "username": "james",
  "userId": "5edff358a0fcb779aa7b118b"
}
```

* `PUT` to update a thought by its `_id`

* `DELETE` to remove a thought by its `_id`

---

**`/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions`**

* `POST` to create a reaction stored in a single thought's `reactions` array field

* `DELETE` to pull and remove a reaction by the reaction's `reactionId` value
